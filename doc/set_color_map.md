## Applying a palette to an image color map

First make sure your image is in indexed mode. If it's not, go to `Image ->
Mode -> Indexed`

![Indexed mode](/screenshots/mode-indexed-menu.png)

And once in the Indexed Color Conversion dialog select "Use custom palette" and
pick the palette you want, it will be applied as your color map.

If your image was already indexed, you can swap the color map with a palette by
going to `Colors -> Map -> Set Colormap...`

![Set colormap](/screenshots/set-colormap-menu.png)

And then pick the palette you want.
